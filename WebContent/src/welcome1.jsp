	     to the software industries so many years! Although this application is not an open source software but it was built by our founder Mr. Srimanta Jana,
	      who contributed TestMax open source automation platform that seamlessly can be integrated with this product for building Test Automation script
	      very quickly. This will help to grow further the open source 
	     community and many startups will use this software for free to reduce their cost of services.
	    </p>
	</div>
    <div class="fullarticle" id="article3">
	    <h3>Sandbox for trial:</h3>
	    <p>We encourage you to use Sandbox first and try out our solution in many ways. The production environment is controlled environment and
	     every company should assign a group of administrators who can add or assign role to other users and educate them how to use this software. 
	     As a trial, everybody can <a href="http://sandbox.artitelly.com/testrepo/service" >Sign up to Sandbox</a> through registration page, where as in production environment, 
	     we promote users from Sandbox to production after a one day training.
	     Although Artitelly, does not charge any monthly fee for any production account but we charge a little amount for training to keep our service for free.
	    
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     This one day training is recommended for few people in every company since there are little bit concepts needed to use this product more efficient way.
	    </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article4">
	    <h3>Promotion to production account from Sandbox:</h3>
	    <p> When you are ready to promote your account to production after trial, we recommend your some folks to take one day training
	    to ask questions, learn process and how to use many features available in this software.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     During the training, our instructor will promote your company account to production and you will get your administrative account in the production.
	     After you get promoted your account to production, you can create new accounts for your company folks. We do not allow multiple group account using same domian.
	     If you need multiple group account for your company, you can use other domian or sub domian in that case.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     Production environment is controlled environment and we promote each group account after verifying your company and giving training to few folks.
	    </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article5">
	    <h3>Register training from Sandbox:</h3>
	    <p> Once you look at demo project and try out with our solution in Sandbox, you can sign up for training from your Sandbox account.
	    
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Upon receiving your training request we will notify you through email and phone, then you can make your payment to confirm registration. 
	    Once we get confirmation, our instructor will enter your name with their list and allocate a seat for you either remotely or on-site.

	    </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article6">
	    <h3>Direct product access through support and contact:</h3>
	    <p> Although we don't recommend to give any one production access or register directly through our web site, but you may request it creating a support ticket from the Sandbox.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Based on our verification about your company's interest and presence via direct call or meeting by our support personal, we may grant you access to our production env. 
	    The main issue is, we do not allow other person to use your domian and create production account which may possible if we allow direct registration for production env. 
	    We maintain the users group using your company domain with genuine presence to avoid conflict with intruders.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    We always recommend to get production access with direct contact and proper training such that we do not waste our production resource for intruders or inactive accounts.
	    </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article7">
	    <h3>Artitelly Enterprise Test Automation Solution:</h3>
	    <p> Mainly, the free production account will help you to organize your product, multiple projects, different release and sprint cycles,
	    features, scenerios, test case, execution, results, analytics, tasks, time, defects etc. However, if you like to update results for automated test
	    using our free cloud solution, we won't allow that since this is shared database and environment for many companies. However, the work around is
	    you have to manually update test execution results for each scenerios one time during your project or sprint and you can not update
	    daily build or automated test results from your CI. Many companies may take this approach to avoid service fee for enterprise solution we provide.
	    
	    </p>
	    <p>
	   But, if you would like to run your CI automation and want to update test results everyday, you need Artitelly, Enterprise solution which
	   has it's own dedicated secured database in cloud. Your database will be isolated from our shared instance and you can run your automation script
	   and directly update test results to your instance.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     Your payment for Enterprise solution could be based on instance size and we charge as instance hour for each year. 
	     The hourly rate depends on the size of instance and it is very nominal rate much more cheaper than any other vendors.
	    </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article8">
	    <h3>Integration with Automation Framework:</h3>
	    <p> If you would like to run your automated tests and like to update test results to your dedicated Enterprise instance, we provide client
	    libraries and you just need to invoke a service which will be installed in your app.
	    </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article9">
	    <h3>TestMax Automation Framework:</h3>
	    <p> TestMax is an automation platform which is an open source software developed by our founding member Mr.Srimanta Jana. This is available in Github and Source Forge.
	    You can obtain the source code in Github. It allows you to build rapid automated tests only through configuration. You may not require to write any Java code to automate your application.
	    However it supports Java, Java Script and XML injectors and more recently cucumber will be plugged in with this framework.
	    </p>
	    <p>Using this framework, you can not only automate frontend tests, but also you can automate REST APIs, Database, TestNG, Junit, Cucumber etc. using single framework and
	    passing data from one container to another. 
	    
	    </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article10">
	    <h3>TestMax integration with Testrepo:</h3>
	    <p> Unlike other automation framework, TestMax also invokes testrepo client through services. But this will come with the benefit
	    that you can use directly through configuration without writing your automation code through inbuilt injectors.
	    </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article11">
	    <h3>Referential income:</h3>
	    <p> You can earn upto 20% of the amount we receive from any training we provide through your reference. Please feel free to provide references using
	    your friend's company email address, phone number and once we register anybody from your friend's company through your reference, we will show your 
	    eligibility to claim referential income.
	    </p>
	    
	     <p> To qualify you for referential income, you should be the first person to provide email address of the person of the other company using their 
	     domain in email address and contact number.
	     When any of the person sign up for that company to attend training, we look for the first person who has given us correct email address and phone number as a referral. 
	     If your contact information was not correct then we qualify the second person if any one given reference to that company.
	    </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article12">
	    <h3>On-Demand Automation Resource Services:</h3>
	    <p> We provide On-demand automation developers with 20% cheaper rate than your local consultants. Our automation developers are very experienced 
	    and trained to use our default automation platform called TestMax which is already integrated with our cloud solution. 
	    You can book automation resource any time of development phase and they can work with your QE lead or with agile team parallel 
	    to your project. They can quickly build automation scripts and run them along with your Feature Run using Jenkin or your own CI infrastructure.
	    Your agile team can see test execution results in the agile dashboard and get quick coverage by reducing backlog. 
	    </p>
	    
	     <p> However, if you are using your own automation framework and still you can book are automation developers who can work with your project. 
	     Our open resource management platform allows freelancer to participate in this program after some training. 
	     Although we committed to supply our own trained resources most of the time after negotiating the hours and rate with our clients.
	    </p>
	</div>

	    <h3>Automation Test Execution Results & Screen shots:</h3>
	    <p> Yes, you can run your automation tests just with a button click from Test Run. Also you can see the screen shots and reports.
	    </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fullarticle" id="article14">
	    <h3>TestMax and record playback:</h3>
	    <p> Although there any many Test Frameworks available in the market which support record any playback but TestMax is a framework 
	    where you have full control and you can use any automation technology you like. Most of the cases people are using many open source softwares 
	    like Selenium, Cucumber, Junit, TestNg, Jasmine, Python, Jython, Ruby etc.
	    You can use any of these technology using our framework. Also you can use our XML configuration frameworks without writing any code.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Another advantage is, if you need to test end-to-end, like run frontend, verify results with rest call, call database, pass data to Junit , 
	    TestNg or Java API etc. like this you can build your very complex tests using our tool.
	    </p>
	     <p>

	    If anything need customization they will help you get it immediately such that you can eliminate any delay to get it fixed by us. Our competetors netither supply on-demand automation resource nor they
	    write and maintain complex script that can run in your private CI or CI infrastructure built by us.
	    </p>
	</div>
